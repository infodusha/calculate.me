This is the last project of the foundations course on TOP. It's an online calculator, creatively named "calculate.me". A couple of things it should be able to do:

1. [x] Have a responsive graphical inteface that is tied to a JS file containing the logic. That includes a display that should tell the number that was pressed
2. [x] Be able to add, subtract, divide and multiply
3. [x] It should be able to foolow the math rules of priorities when division is called along with subtraction or addition (12 + 7 - 5 \* 3 = should NOT yield 42)
4. [x] Long decimals should be rounded to avoid overflow
5. [x] Pressing = before entering numbers should not affect the stability of the program
6. [x] "Clear" button should clear the display, along with not crashing the program if called upon while the display is empty
7. [x] Should give appropriate error if divided by 0
8. Should not let more than 1 dot appear in a single digit
9. [x] Should have "backspace"
10. [x] Should have keyboard support
