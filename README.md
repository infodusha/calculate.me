This is the last project of the foundations course on TOP. It's an online calculator, creatively named "calculate.me". A couple of things it should be able to do:

1. Have a responsive graphical inteface that is tied to a JS file containing the logic. That includes a display that should tell the number that was pressed
2. DONE Be able to add, subtract, divide and multiply
3. DONE It should be able to foolow the math rules of priorities when division is called along with subtraction or addition (12 + 7 - 5 \* 3 = should NOT yield 42)
4. Long decimals should be rounded to avoid overflow
5. Pressing = before entering numbers should not affect the stability of the program
6. DONE "Clear" button should clear the display, along with not crashing the program if called upon while the display is empty
7. Should give appropriate error if divided by 0
8. Should not let more than 1 dot appear in a single digit
9. Should have "backspace"
10. Should have keyboard support
